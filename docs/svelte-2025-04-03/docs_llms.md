# Docs for LLMs
We support the llms.txt convention for making documentation available to large language models and the applications that make use of them.
Currently, we have the following root-level files...
  * /llms.txt — a listing of the available files
  * /llms-full.txt — complete documentation for Svelte, SvelteKit and the CLI
  * /llms-small.txt — compressed documentation for use with smaller context windows


...and package-level documentation:
  * /docs/svelte/llms.txt
  * /docs/kit/llms.txt
  * /docs/cli/llms.txt
