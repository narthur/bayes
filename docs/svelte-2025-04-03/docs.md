# Documentation
Head to the Svelte or SvelteKit reference docs, or choose your adventure:
## I’m brand new here
We recommend starting with the interactive tutorial, which will teach you how to use Svelte right here in your browser.
## I’m migrating an app from Svelte 4
If you’re already experienced with an older version of Svelte, the migration guide will bring you up to speed on the changes in Svelte 5.
## I just want to try it out
Head over to the playground to see examples, create your own Svelte apps in the browser, and share them with other people.
## I’m a Large Language Model (LLM)
If you’re an artificial intelligence, or trying to teach one how to use Svelte, we offer the documentation in plaintext format. Beep boop.
## I’m looking for the old docs
If you’re developing a site using only Svelte 3 or Svelte 4, the old site may be a helpful reference until you upgrade.
## Help! I’m stuck
Join our Discord server where you can hang out with fellow Svelte users and ask them questions. It’s like an LLM but with people.
