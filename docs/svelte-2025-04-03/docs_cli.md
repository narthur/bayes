The command line interface (CLI), `sv`, is a toolkit for creating and maintaining Svelte applications.
## Usage
The easiest way to run `sv` is with `npx` (or the equivalent command if you’re using a different package manager — for example, `pnpx` if you’re using pnpm):
```
npx sv <command> <args>
```

If you’re inside a project where `sv` is already installed, this will use the local installation, otherwise it will download the latest version and run it without installing it, which is particularly useful for `sv create`.
## Acknowledgements
Thank you to Christopher Brown who originally owned the `sv` name on npm for graciously allowing it to be used for the Svelte CLI. You can find the original `sv` package at `@chbrown/sv`.
