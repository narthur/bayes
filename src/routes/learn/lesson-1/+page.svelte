			<h2>What is Bayesian Thinking?</h2>
			<p>
				Bayesian thinking is a way of reasoning about uncertainty that differs fundamentally from traditional
				statistical approaches. It's based on the idea that probability represents a degree of belief,
				which can be updated as new evidence becomes available.
			</p>

			<h2>Bayesian vs. Frequentist Approaches</h2>
			<p>
				There are two main schools of thought in statistics:

				<h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 mb-4">Frequentist Approach</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Probability is viewed as the long-run frequency of events</li>
					<li>Relies on p-values and confidence intervals</li>
					<li>Cannot assign probabilities to hypotheses (they're either true or false)</li>
					<li>Focuses on "What's the probability of this data if the hypothesis is true?"</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-lg p-6 mb-8 border border-slate-200 dark:border-slate-700">
				<h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 mb-4">Bayesian Approach</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Probability represents degree of belief</li>
					<li>Uses prior knowledge and updates it with new evidence</li>
					<li>Can assign probabilities to hypotheses</li>
					<li>Answers "What's the probability the hypothesis is true given this data?"</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<h2>Basic Probability Concepts</h2>
			
			<h3>Probability Scale</h3>
			<p>
				Probabilities range from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain), or 0% to 100%. For example:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0% - Impossible event (like rolling a 7 on a six-sided die)</li>
				<li>50% - Equal chance (like getting heads on a fair coin)</li>
				<li>100% - Certain event (like rolling a number â‰¤ 6 on a six-sided die)</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Conditional Probability</h3>
			<p>
				The probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. Written as P(A|B),
				read as "probability of A given B". For example:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What's the probability it's raining (A) given that there are dark clouds (B)?</li>
				<li>What's the probability someone has a disease (A) given they tested positive (B)?</li>
			</ul>
